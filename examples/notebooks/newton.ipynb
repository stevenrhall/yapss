        "Newton's *Minimal Resistance Problem* is the first known calculus of variations problem, published in Isaac Newton's *Principia Mathematica* in 1687 <cite data-footcite=\"Newton:1687\">(Newton, 1687)</cite>. The problem is to find the convex solid of revolution (a nose cone) that has the lowest resistance (drag) when it moves through a rarefied gas along the axis of symmetry. In Newton's model, gas particles do not interact with each other, and bounce off the nose cone elastically with no loss. The nose cone is assumed to be convex (and axisymmetric) so that there are no additional collisions after the first. For a modern treatment of Newton's problem, including the assumption of convexity and axisymmetry, see the paper by Buttazzo and Kawohl <cite data-footcite=\"Buttazzo:2001\">(2001)</cite>. The convexity assumption is stronger than required to assure that each particle experiences only a single collision, but relaxing the convexity and axisymmetry assumptions while ensuring that each particle experiences only a single collision is quite complicated. See for example the paper by Compte and Lachand-Robert <cite data-footcite=\"Comte:2001\">(2001)</cite>. For this example, we'll keep Newton's simpler assumptions.\n",

        "Consider first the drag on a right circular cylinder with radius $R$. A gas particle with velocity $v$ relative to the body will bounce elastically off the circular end with velocity $v$ in the opposite direction. For a particle with mass $m$, the net impulse on the cylinder will then be the net change in momentum of the particle, $2mv$. For the rarefied gas, the drag is  similarly twice the momentum flux striking the end of the cylinder, $D=2 \\rho v^2 \\pi R^2$. The drag coefficient is then\n",
